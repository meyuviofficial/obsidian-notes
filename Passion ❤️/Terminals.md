# Why Terminals? 
Being a SRE, my daily day-to-day job is to make love with terminals. I use commands day-in and day-out. I admired few "Youtubers" like [typecraft-dev]([Typecraft Dev](https://github.com/typecraft-dev)), [josean-martinez]([Typecraft Dev](https://github.com/typecraft-dev)), [devops toolbox]([omerxx (Omer Hamerman)](https://github.com/omerxx)) and got passionate about terminal ricing. I initially started with Windows Terminal and MacOS terminal. Then, I started using [iterm2]([Documentation - iTerm2 - macOS Terminal Replacement](https://iterm2.com/documentation.html)) which was really good and did the job as a replacement for the default one. Then, the whole rust wave came and there was a hunger for more advanced terminal started.
